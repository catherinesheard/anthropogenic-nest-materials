# anthropogenic-nest-materials

Data and code for Sheard et al., "Anthropogenic nest material use correlates with human landscape modifications in a global sample of birds", currently in review.

The code "anthropogenic - full model - brains" has the most annotations; all six code files are pretty repetitive.

The tree files are too large to be posted to GitHub, but can be obtained from https://birdtree.org/ or by contacting the first author (catherine.sheard@abdn.ac.uk).

Metadata for the data posted here can be found in the supplementary material of the main manuscript.
